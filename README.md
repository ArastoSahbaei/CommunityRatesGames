# Community Rates Games
This project was born on 31/10-18

Five unemployed dudes with one given goal, one destination, to create a community for devoted video-game admirers to share their their thoughts and opinions.
This quest meant a long distance from society and human interraction, but since none of them were familiar with it anyway they took their equipment and settled in a deep dark dungeon in the rainy forest of Scandanavia.
